The <strong>ndarray</strong> is a <em>homogeneous n-dimensional array</em> object. What does that mean? ü§® </p><p>A Python List or a Pandas DataFrame can contain a mix of strings, numbers, or objects (i.e., a mix of different types). <strong>Homogenous</strong> means all the data have to have the same data type, for example all floating-point numbers.</p><p>And <strong>n-dimensional</strong> means that we can work with everything from a single column (1-dimensional) to the matrix (2-dimensional) to a bunch of matrices stacked on top of each other (n-dimensional).</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-12_15-34-45-6fdebf22c1ab4c51fd82687144c0f215.gif"></figure><h4>1-Dimension</h4><p>Let‚Äôs create a 1-dimensional array (i.e., a ‚Äúvector‚Äù)</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_array = np.array([1.1, 9.2, 8.1, 4.7])</pre><p>We can see <code>my_array</code> is 1 dimensional by looking at its shape</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_array.shape</pre><p>We access an element in a ndarray similar to how we work with a Python List, namely by that element's index:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_array[2]</pre><p>Let‚Äôs check the dimensions of my_array with the <code>ndim</code> attribute:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">my_array.ndim</pre><h4><img height="674" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-12_09-45-49-516f9f87a63a881bad1f7d13a190b2a5.png" width="606"></h4><h4>2-Dimensions</h4><p>Now, let‚Äôs create a 2-dimensional array (i.e., a ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù)</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 9], [5, 6, 7, 8]])</pre><p>Note we have two pairs of square brackets.

print(array_2d)</pre><p>Again, you can access a particular row or a particular value with the square bracket notation. To access a particular value, you have to provide an index for each dimension.

Yes, that‚Äôs also where Tensorflow, the popular machine learning tool, gets its name. A tensor simply refers to an n-dimensional array. Using what you've learned about 1- and 2-dimensional arrays, can you apply the same techniques to tackle a more complex array?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Challenge</strong></p><ul><li><p>How many dimensions does the array below have?</p></li><li><p>What is its shape (i.e., how many elements are along each axis)?</p></li><li><p>Try to access the value <code>18</code> in the last line of code.</p></li><li><p>Try to retrieve a 1-dimensional vector with the values <code>[97, 0, 27, 18]</code></p></li><li><p>Try to retrieve a (3,2) matrix with the values <code>[[ 0, 4], [ 7, 5], [ 5, 97]]</code></p></li></ul><pre class="prettyprint linenums">mystery_array = np.array([[[0, 1, 2, 3],

print(f'The shape is {mystery_array.shape}')</pre><p>The shape is (3, 2, 4), so we have 3 elements along axis #0, 2 elements along axis #1 and 4 elements along axis #3. </p><p>To access the value <code>18</code> we, therefore, have to provide three different indices - one for each axis. As such, we locate the number at index 2 for the first axis, index number 1 for the second axis, and index number 3 for the third axis.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">mystery_array[2, 1, 3]</pre><p>The values [97, 0, 27, 18] live on the 3rd axis and are on position 2 for the first axis and position 1 on the second axis. Hence we can retrieve them like so:</p><p><br></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">mystery_array[2, 1, :]</pre><p>Finally, to retrieve all the first elements on the third axis, we can use the colon operator for the other two dimensions.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">mystery_array[:, :, 0]</pre><p>With the square brackets serving as your guide, the ndarray is quite difficult to visualise for 3 or more dimensions. So if any of this was unclear or confusing. Pause on this lesson for a minute and play around with the array above. Try selecting different subsets from the array. That way you can get comfortable thinking along the different dimensions of the ndarray.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-12_10-05-16-0b2602de044a3b75e9e084c6f329d39c.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
