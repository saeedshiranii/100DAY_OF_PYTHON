<p>No Data Science course can be complete without learning NumPy (<strong>Numerical Python</strong>). NumPy is a Python library thatâ€™s used in almost every field of science and engineering. Itâ€™s practically <strong>THE</strong> standard for working with numerical data in Python. The case studies for how NumPy is being used speak for themselves ðŸ˜®&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-12_10-22-08-b0c1d1c029ea910a79ae216ff161c1c1.png"></figure><p>So far, weâ€™ve been using Pandas, which is built on top of NumPy. Think of Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool that includes functionality for working with time-series or for grouping, joining, merging and finding missing data (i.e., everything weâ€™ve been doing so far). NumPy on the other hand shines with low-level tasks, like doing serious math and calculations.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Today you'll learn: </strong></p><ul><li><p>How to leverage the power ðŸ’ª of NumPy's ndarrays.</p></li><li><p>How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.</p></li><li><p>How broadcasting ðŸ“£ works with ndarrays.</p></li><li><p>How to do linear algebra with NumPy.</p></li><li><p>How to generate points that you can plot on a chart.</p></li><li><p>How to manipulate images as ndarrays. <br></p></li></ul><p><img height="253" src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-10-12_10-09-26-7787e15311eec7748b7ef1aa01140549.png" width="563"></p><p><strong>Download and add the Notebook to Google Drive</strong></p><p>As usual, download the .zip file from this lesson and extract it.
