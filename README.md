The **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu is a comprehensive online course designed to take students from beginner to professional level in Python programming. Over the span of 100 days, students engage in building 100 unique projects, dedicating about an hour each day to learning and development. The curriculum covers a wide range of Python applications, including data science, automation, web development, game development, and more. Participants also learn to use tools and libraries such as Selenium, Beautiful Soup, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn, Plotly, and Matplotlib. This bootcamp is not only about coding; it's about building a portfolio of projects that can showcase one's skills to potential employers. With no prior programming experience required, Dr. Yu's bootcamp is accessible to anyone with an internet connection and a willingness to learn.


I finished the Python bootcamp a while back and have been updating my Python skills ever since. I've also been applying the data analysis libraries and tools I learned there to my projects. Thanks to the bootcamp, I now feel confident taking on new challenges and am ready to tackle any programming Task, whether it involves Python or not.
